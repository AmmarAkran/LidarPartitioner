# LidarPartitioner
Lidar-Partitioner is a novel tool that enables the partitioning of lidar data by dividing it into several chunks with somewhat the same sizes.


## Lidar algorithms
We applied two algorithms to check the correctness of the partitioning and to measure what is the optimal partition
size of lidar data.
